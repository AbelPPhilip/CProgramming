The Projects are as following:

1. Project 1 :- A C Program that receives inputs on Assignment data (Score, Weightage, Days Late, Late Penalty) and calculates a Numeric Score based on the data. The program also provides a statistic (mean, standard deviation,...) on all the assignment data provided.
2. Project 2 :- A program that allows the user to create a document 
3. Project 3 :- A user interface that imitates a shell allowing the user to create a document, and perform many other functionalities. 
4. Project 4 :- A Calendar managing program that enables the user to create a calendar, and manage events within the calendar. 
5. Project 5 :- This project's main purpose was to provide practice in Assembly language. Thus programs such as palindrome, is_square root, reverse prefix and fibonacci were coded in Assembly
6. Project 6 :- A C program that intended to mimick the function of a shell, that performed functions based on the shell user inputs. Moreover the program performs the functions efficiently through concurrency.
